# Chrome Extension for Tubio
Authors note:  
Since I am no longer using chromium, this is no longer maintained.

Adds a context-menu and a popup to download videos instantly.  
It does not open Tubio for you. It just downloads the videos. But you can click a button in the extensions popup that takes you to Tubio.  

For now this is not on the chrome store, but you can easily install unlisted extensions from source as shown [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=Click%20the%20Chrome%20menu%20icon,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
